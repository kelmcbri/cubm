!  The CUBM Application as of version 1.2 sends the current time from the router to Cloverleaf.
!  This time stamp shows up on the Bed Board at the facility for when a bed was marked clean.
!  You will want to setup the router to have the correct time!
!
! Set the correct timezone for your location
clock timezone CST -6
! Configure Daylight Savings Time if appropriate for your location
clock summer-time CDT recurring
!
! Now set up NTP service to get proper time from HCAs NTP servers.
! You may want to manually set the clock on the router before implementing NTP since it takes
!    a long time for NTP to associate with the router and converge to correct time.
!  Manually set clock from exec prompt - not config prompt:   Router# clock set 10:50:00 Oct 26 2006
!
! HCA currently has 3 NTP servers - configure to all of them
ntp server 10.26.10.100
ntp server 10.90.10.100
ntp server 10.154.10.100
!
!  You can check on the NTP Associations with show ntp status and show ntp associations commands.
!   The "show clock" command will show you what time the router has.

! Include a loopback interface IF you are using this same router as a cisco PBX
!  CUBM only answers INCOMING calls and a phone on this router is dialing OUTBOUND.
!   So we send the call OUT to the loopback address and then receive it as an
!   Inbound call at that point.  Tricky.
